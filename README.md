- A project I worked on that died when crypto markets started crashing, but gave me a lot of experience with some smart contract development & front end development along with [RazaEngineering](https://github.com/razaengineering) doing a lot of the web3.js work.
- Was supposed to be procgen images stored in IPFS.  Art was never generated.

    - First 1111 to be free 
    - Max 7 mints at one time
    - .032 ETH per mint
